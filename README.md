# Illumination-and-Shading-Version-1.0

This project implements a WebGL application focused on illumination and shading, using a perspective camera that fills the entire browser window. The scene is illuminated using the Phong lighting model, with the option to compute lighting per vertex (Gouraud shading) or per fragment (Phong shading).
